    "In Flask , the request object is used to access incoming request data submitted by a client when interacting with a Flask web application. the request object provides a way to inspect and manipulate the data is sent to the server from the client during an HTTP request.\n",
    "1. Accessing Request Data:\n",
    "    the \"request\" object allows you to access various parts of the incoming HTTP request, such as form data , URL parameterss, headers, cookies, and uploaded files.\n",

    "When a user submits an HTML from via a POST request, the form data can be accessed through the \"request.form\" attribute in Flask .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. JSON Data:\n",
    "If the client sends JSON data in the request body (e.g., via an AJAX request), Flask allows you to access this data through the request.json attribute. This is common when building RESTful APIs with Flask.\n",

    "The request object in Flask is part of the request context, which is a way to temporarily store information related to the current request being processed by the application. This context makes request-related data accessible throughout the handling of a request without explicitly passing it around."
